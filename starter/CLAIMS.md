## Reflection

**One AI claim I didn't trust at first and how I verified it:**

*[Write 2–3 sentences. What did the AI say? Why did it feel wrong? What source confirmed or denied it?]*

One of the AI claims that I did not trust at first was that one of the pivotal places that helped develop Swiss Style was the Basel School of Design. I did not see it appear in my initial exploration / research phase, so I wanted to verify that it was indeed tied to Armin Hoffman. This source https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_catalogue_1811_300062659.pdf verified it.
