Bauhaus was more experimental and expressive than Swiss design. Bauhaus workshops encouraged material play, craft exploration, and interdisciplinary practice.

New Wave did not reject Swiss modernism. It emerged from inside it.

Swiss Style is not pure Minimalism, it is built on strict systems while Minimalism can exist without structural rigor.

Illegibility can be intentional communication.
It forces readers to slow down or feel something instead of passively absorbing information.

## DECISIONS

| Decision | Your Answer |
|---|---|
| Grunge Typography | [Grunge - It strongly rejected Swiss style. I personally dislike modern corporate styles myself and would like to learn more about how this counter style emerged from it.] |
| David Carson | [David Carson — He is known for Grunge typography and anti-legibility. He is most knowledgable on this style compared to the other experts.] |

## THINGS I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT

```
After research, what did you reverse on? If nothing, you were not
paying attention or you already knew everything. Pick one.
```

1. I initially thought that Bauhaus was lifeless and rigid, and did not know it was more expressive that Swiss.
2. Swiss seems to be more akin to the "lifeless" corporate styles we see today.
