    <!-- Card 1: Bauhaus -->

      <h2>Bauhaus</h2>
      <p class="date-range">1919–1933</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Founded in 1919 in Weimar, the Bauhaus advanced Modernism through Functionalism and workshop-based education integrating art, craft, and industry. Instruction began with the Vorkurs, a foundation course examining materials, color, and form before specialization. Faculty unified architecture, typography, textiles, and industrial design under Gesamtkunstwerk, positioning architecture as the synthesis of disciplines. The school aligned artistic practice with industrial production, rejecting academic hierarchy in favor of collaborative workshops. Relocated to Dessau in 1925 and closed in 1933, its faculty later disseminated its methods internationally, shaping twentieth-century design practice.</p>

    <!-- Card 2: Swiss Style -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>Swiss Style</h2>
      <p class="date-range">International Typographic Style · 1950s–1970s</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Emerging in postwar Switzerland, this movement refined Modernism through disciplined typographic study and structural control. Designers employed the grid system to organize hierarchy, strengthening legibility through asymmetry and precise alignment. Grounded in Rationalism, compositions emphasized contrast, scale, and photographic imagery alongside sans-serif type. Developed through pedagogical models at institutions such as the Basel School of Design, the movement prioritized perceptual clarity and formal training. While extending Bauhaus principles, it systematized them into reproducible frameworks for editorial and identity design.</p>

    <!-- Card 3: Reaction (choose New Wave OR Grunge) -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>Grunge Typography</h2>
      <p class="date-range">1990s</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Grunge Typography emerged in the 1990s through experimental editorial practice, particularly in Ray Gun magazine under art director David Carson. Designers employed deconstruction, distortion, and layering, disrupting conventional hierarchy and challenging traditional standards of legibility. Letterforms appeared fragmented, textured, or obscured, allowing visual form to respond directly to editorial content. Rather than following grid discipline, compositions privileged intuition and expressive structure. While grounded in knowledge of modernist typography, the work intentionally resisted fixed rules of alignment and typographic neutrality.</p>
